Hi team 

This mail is to describe the next homework, homework 05 

Objective: develop the skills to program an application that solves a problem using threads 

Problem: We must calculate the value of Pi ( 3.141596 ) using this algorithm: 

npoints = 10000
circle_count = 0

do j = 1,npoints
  generate 2 random numbers between 0 and 1
  xcoordinate = random1
  ycoordinate = random2
  if (xcoordinate, ycoordinate) inside circle
  then circle_count = circle_count + 1
end do

PI = 4.0*circle_count/npoints

( more info: https://computing.llnl.gov/tutorials/parallel_comp/ ) 

Please send me the code as a patch and include in the comments of the code (at the top), the results in terms of a link to a graph that shows the speed improvements, how much time does it take to calculate pi with 1 thread, 2 threads 4 threads 8 threads and 16 threads? 

in order to measure the time you can use the time command from Linux

or you can code it:

whatever you prefer :) 

the link could be to a google documents pdf. please create good graphs: 

-> X axis = number of threads 
-> Y axis = speed in time ( make the scale start in 0 ) 
-> Title

Have fun, the homework is for Thursday
