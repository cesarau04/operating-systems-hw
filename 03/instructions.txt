Homework 03

Date : Monday 05 February at 12 PM ( midnight )

1) Read the practices, do the exercises you consider, but read all the
4 PDFs, please
2) In order to prove yourself that you know how to surf on the Linux
command line like a full pro, we are going to do a small project of
real life Linux hacker :). We are going to do a BASH script that does
this

a ) First, you need to clone the Linux Kernel Source code from:

git clone https://github.com/torvalds/linux.git

b) You will see it has multiple directories, but,  how much files does each
directory contain?

The first thing your bash script should do is to print the number of
files per directory ( extra points if you show it in a graph with gnu
plot). Something like this ( fake numbers are used )

# Documentation = 1234 files
# arch = 789 files
# block = 876 files

c) What files exist in the Kernel Source code? Let's make your BASH
script print this information as:

# Number of README* (files as README.Locking also count)
# Number of Kconfig files
# Number of Kbuild files
# Number of Makefiles files
# Number of .c files
# Number of .h files
# Number of .pl files
# Number of others files

Total number of files =

d) How many times the library " #include <linux/module.h>" appears in
all the C and H documents you found? Let's make your BASH script print
that:

# Number of times the " #include <linux/module.h>" appears =

e) Copy all the C and H files to these directories

C_FILES
H_FILES

f) Count the number of files in these directories, they should be the
same as the ones we count in section C right? :

# Number of .c files
# Number of .h files

DONE, you are a happy Linux user :)

In order to send me the homework, send me the patch under labs/02


Happy weekend :)

make me proud !!!
